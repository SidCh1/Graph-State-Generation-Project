## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Setup

Ensure all files are in the **same directory**.

### 2. Generate Data

Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Run_statistics.ipynb
```

This will:

* Generate all datasets except for Bell-pair sources.
* Reproduce figures from the paper

---

## 📊 Core Functionality

The main script:

```
calculate_gates_bell_paris_main.py
```

Provides functions to:

* Perform gate and Bell-pair analysis
* Generate plots used in the paper except for Bell-pair sources.

---

## 🔗 Bell Pair Source Simulations

Perform Bell-pair sources analysis:

### Erdős–Rényi (ER)

```bash
python Bell_Pair_Sources_fix_P_ER.py
```

### Barabási–Albert (BA)

```bash
python Bell_Pair_Sources_fix_C_BA.py
```
